# HEART-DEFECT-MONITORING-BY-INTEGRATING-IOT-AND-ECG-TECHNOLOGY-
This project monitors heart defects using IoT-based ECG. It continuously records real-time heart activity through sensors, detects abnormal rhythms, and instantly alerts the user for timely medical attention. This Project records the monitoring of the heart defects using ECG based on IOT. It continuously provides the electrical activity of the heart in the real time information based on the heart health and uses sensors to capture the ECG signals. It allows the user to detect any abnormalities in heart rhythms. Which immediately alerts the user and provides the health care, enabling quick medical attention. The IOT Technology has almost enter in all aspects of the day-to-day life. This device receives the senor data and store it in a data base. Any sensor values that surpass the limit will alert the user. The project is based on IOT technology providing continuous heart monitoring using ECG Sensor. The data received from the device detects the heart defect by analysing ECG signals in real-time and provides the instant alert to the user. It combines ECG Sensors, IOT Technology, Cloud Computing and Data analysis algorithm. From the past decade there has been immense development in technology related to health monitoring. The advancement in this project is that it is accessible from remote areas. It indicates the severity of the heartbeat deflection on display. This project uses the Arduino platform consisting of both software and hardware modules. These methods have made health care much more comfortable to reach out as well as easily accessible to by humankind. They are easily affordable cost which provides quality service. An electrocardiogram (ECG) is a test that records the electrical signals in the heart over a specific period. The heart generates electrical impulses that cause it to contract and pump blood. These impulses are recorded by electrodes placed on the skin, providing valuable data on heart rate, rhythm, and function.
